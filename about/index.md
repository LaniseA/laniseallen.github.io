Hello, my name is **Lanise Allen** and I am originally from Miami Gardens, Florida. I studied **Sociology** at University of Florida and graduated in 2015. 

While enrolled at the University of Florida, I worked in various office support roles within the University, and interned with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida. I then worked with Victoria & Associates as a temporary office assistant, assigned to Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd (RCCL). In January 2017, I worked as a Non-Clinical Case Coordinator in Royal Caribbean's Risk Management Department, responsible for overseeing prompt and adequate medical care for ill and injured cruise ship employees in their home country. It was there that I learned a few aspects of computer and IT support, and the Salesforce cloud-based platform. In September of 2019, I enrolled in Generation USA, a 12-week intensive program in partnership with Amazon Web Services to become a Certified Cloud Support Practitioner. There, I developed knowledge on AWS cloud fundamentals including: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM and Databases, the Well Architected Framework and Cloud Adoption Framework, AWS Security and Networking best practices, coding with Python, HTML, CSS, and learning Linux OS.

In November 2019, I received the **AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification**. Then, in January 2020, began an internship with Belle Fleur Technologies, an AWS Advanced Consulting partner. In conjunction with the internship, I received the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification** in March 2020.

In the coming months, I will sit for the **AWS Developer Associate Certification** and **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**. I would also like to finish completing my **Master's Degree in Business Administration** in the near future.
