Hello, my name is **Lanise Allen** and I am originally from Miami Gardens, Florida. I studied **Sociology** at University of Florida and graduated in 2015. 

While enrolled at the University of Florida, I worked in various office support roles within the University, and interned with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida. I then worked with Victoria & Associates as a temporary office assistant, assigned to Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd (RCCL). In January 2017, I worked as a Non-Clinical Case Coordinator in Royal Caribbean's Risk Management Department, responsible for ensuring prompt and adequate medical care for ill and injured cruise ship employees in their home country. It was there that I learned a few aspects of computer and IT support. In September of 2019, I enrolled in Generation USA, a 12-week intensive program in partnership with Amazon Web Services to become a Cloud Support Practitioner.

Upon completing this program, I will seek opportunities to work in Entry Level positions in IT. I will also study for the **AWS Solutions Architect and AWS SysOps Certification**. I would also like to complete my **Master's Degree in Business Administration** in the near future.
